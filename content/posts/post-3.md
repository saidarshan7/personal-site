###  Mindset

- First of all keep in mind that Everything is Simple then it Looks.
- Tell  your mind that " it's probably simple let me see what it actually is"
- It is not hard it is just new

###  Step 1
- When you see a concept ask yourself:
     - what really happening here if i ignore all the fancy words ?
     - meaning get an high level overview of concept ?
 - example:
     -  what is machine learning ?
     > Instead of thinking “machine learning” is some magical domain, strip it down — it’s just:
     >“Using data to find patterns and make predictions automatically.”
