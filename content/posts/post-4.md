##  Questions which i am getting constantly?

###  why i am feeling useless ?

i dont know i am feeling incomplete for last few days, i feeling useless even though i start something doing i am giving up or feeling boring.
I gave myself so many promises in my first year that i will make some money till third year and tell my mom that you don't need work now... but hear I am not able cross 7gpa and not able to give any OA in any company which comes to my college, sometimes i get thoughts of dying.... my mom and dad working day and night to earn some penny for my college fees. don't know where i am wasting my time ? i feel like i am not consistent.
